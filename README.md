-Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
-the one i picked was the Grocer project which had my code comb through a input text and output all the food listed in the text and the amount it has apeared along with listing them with numbers with histogram and numbers it also must have the ability to be able to search the food items the main porblem i had solving it was with my dyslexia and maybe an undiganosed ADHD due to how many times cought my self taking to many breaks and difficulty seeing any mistakes i would of had on the code thus taking longer
-What did you do particularly well?
-i think i did really well was the menu inputs with switch commands it made it easier to understand how my menu would work
-Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
-most of it i found it difficult to write most of the resorces i went to was regoing though the zybooks and looking at stackoverflow to see if anyone had any simmilure problems i also had.
-What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
-the skills i have gain would be an aditional code language that to be honest i would not know how much i would come back to C++
